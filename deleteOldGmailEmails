/**
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
 * This script goes through your Gmail inbox and deletes old unlabelled
 * emails with a certain subject or from a certain sender.
 * It only deletes the unlabelled ones so that adding a label is an
 * easy way for you to mark an email as non-deletable, but you can
 * override this.
 * There are functions to delete emails with subjects or from senders
 * older than a week and a month and you can easily add more.
 * You can run everything manually or set up triggers to do it
 * regularly and automatically.
 * You have to write the subjects and senders you want to delete.
 * The search matches subjects that start with the given subjects
 * (useful for e.g. newsletters where the date varies) and senders that
 * are equal to the given senders.
 * You'll receive emails telling you what's been deleted.
 *
 * This script can also send you emails telling you which of the senders
 * in your lists aren't sending emails any more and which senders are
 * sending you too many emails, so that you can update your lists
 * accordingly (or unsubscribe).
 * 
 * HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
 * - Copy the script
 * - Sign in to your Google account and go to https://script.google.com
 * - Paste the script
 * - Save it (save icon) and enter a project name e.g. "DeleteOldEmails"
 * - Optionally, rename the script so that it's not called "Code.gs"
 *   (click on the arrow next to the script name on the left)
 * - Add the subjects that you want to delete when they're older than
 *   a week to WEEK_SUBJECT
 * - Add the senders that you want to delete when they're older than
 *   a week to WEEK_FROM
 * - Add the subjects that you want to delete when they're older than
 *   a month to MONTH_SUBJECT
 * - Add the senders that you want to delete when they're older than
 *   a month to MONTH_FROM
 * - Save your changes
 * Now it's ready to run :)
 * - To run the functions manually, select the function you want to
 *   run in the dropdown menu at the top and hit the "Run" button.
 * - To set up triggers and run the functions automatically, go to
 *   "Edit" > "Current project's triggers" > "No triggers set up.
 *   Click here to add one now." and select which function you want to
 *   run when. You can add more functions clicking on "Add new trigger".
 * Note that you'll have to accept some permissions the first time
 * it runs.
